# Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter
This is a simple Fahrenheit to Celsius converter for anyone who needs it or wants it for fun.
# I AM A BEGINNER
i am a beginner coder so therefore there will not be much detail. i have only had a few hours coding with c++ and have made this for fun. I will update this in the future, but right now dont expect much.
go to [main.cpp](https://github.com/thepsuedospsuedohumuhumunukunukuapuaa/Fahrenheit-to-Celsius-Converter-C-/blob/master/main.cpp) for the code, copy the raw code. after go to your favorite c++ compiler. i usually use [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/) for my test codes. then paste the code inside the text box then run it. you can type a number into the box, hit enter, and it will near automatically give you the exact celsius degree.
